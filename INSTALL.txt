To install DMS from the tarball on Linux, open a terminal and enter the
following commands (replace <version> with the version you're installing):
Note: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, but something similar
should work on most Unix distributions)

1) Install the dependencies (this only needs to be done once):

    sudo apt-get install mediainfo openjdk-7-jre
    # you can also optionally install dcraw and VLC: sudo apt-get install dcraw vlc

2) Download the tarball e.g.:

    # if wget isn't installed, run: sudo apt-get install wget
    wget <URL>

3) Extract the tarball into a dms-<version> directory:

    tar xzvf dms-<version>.tgz

4) Run (note: DMS should NOT be run as root):

    cd dms-<version>
    ./DMS.sh

DMS accesses some files in the dms-<version> directory (the working directory).
Other files will be looked for in ~/.config/DigitalMediaServer
